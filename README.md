PHP exercise

1. This is more of a sudo code rather than working application
2. I was more focused on how to connect everything together rather than making it work
3. TBH I haven't run the application, so I hardly believe it will run
4. The part that I focused most was the fact that the application was supposed to be easily expendable
5. Please find note.pdf with my initial notes.
